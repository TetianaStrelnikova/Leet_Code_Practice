    "### Problem Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "It is often asserted that social network analysis (SNA) can help to identify key players in a network who should be targeted to disrupt organisational terrorist activities. It is thought that measures of centrality might be useful as an investigative tool. The aim of this question is to compute such measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have implemented and provided the class User which represents a user in each network. You must not modify this class as it is complete, however you are advised to consult the class documentation before attempting the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve our aim, we need to implement the class SocialNetwork representing connection between users. Create a module called socialnetwork where you will implement the class SocialNetwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of the class SocialNetwork has the following protected attributes:\n",
    "    • _name a string containing the name of the Network,\n",
    "    • _users, a dictionary containing all users from that network mapped by their id.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the class SocialNetwork forms an implicit graph via users' relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1:\n",
    "Implement the method __init__(name) which takes the name of the Network as a string parameter and initialises the attribute users to an empty dictionary."
