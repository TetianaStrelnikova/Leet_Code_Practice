    "### Problem:\n",
    "You are working with a company that helps customers predict winning lottery numbers. The lottery ticket has six numbers selected from a pool of numbers, say from 1 to 44. After training, a customer is able to predict 15 possible numbers, out of which at least 4 are guaranteed to be on the winning ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to model this scenario and design an algorithm that minimizes the number of lottery tickets the customer needs to buy to ensure at least one ticket contains at least three correct numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Parameters:\n",
    "Total candidate numbers predicted: 15\n",
    "Numbers to choose per ticket: 6\n",
    "At least 4 correct numbers guaranteed in the predicted set\n",
    "You win if at least 3 numbers on the ticket match the winning numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal:\n",
    "Develop a solution that minimizes the number of tickets needed to guarantee a win. Start by thinking about how you can generate the necessary subsets of tickets and how to cover all possible winning combinations."
